# Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure your invoice generator is ready for deployment.

## Pre-Deployment Verification

### Files Required
- [x] `index.html` - Main HTML file
- [x] `app.js` - Application JavaScript
- [x] `logo.png` - Company logo
- [x] `README.md` - Documentation

### Functionality Tests
- [ ] Open `index.html` in a browser
- [ ] Verify logo displays correctly
- [ ] Test adding invoice items
- [ ] Verify calculations (area × price per m² = total)
- [ ] Test PDF generation
- [ ] Check that invoice numbers auto-generate
- [ ] Verify settings modal works
- [ ] Test form clearing

### Browser Testing
- [ ] Chrome/Edge
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Safari
- [ ] Mobile browser (optional)

### File Paths
- [ ] All file references use relative paths
- [ ] `logo.png` is in the same directory as `index.html`
- [ ] Script tag uses `./app.js` (relative path)

### CDN Resources
- [ ] Tailwind CSS CDN loads correctly
- [ ] pdfmake CDN loads correctly
- [ ] All external resources use HTTPS

### Optional Enhancements
- [ ] Add favicon.ico if desired
- [ ] Customize company details if needed
- [ ] Update logo.png with your branding

## Deployment Steps

1. **Prepare Files**
   ```
   - Ensure all files are in the same directory
   - Verify logo.png exists
   - Test locally first
   ```

2. **Choose Deployment Platform**
   - GitHub Pages (free, simple)
   - Netlify (free, drag-and-drop)
   - Vercel (free, Git integration)
   - Traditional web hosting

3. **Upload Files**
   - Upload entire folder contents
   - Maintain directory structure
   - Keep all files together

4. **Test Deployment**
   - Visit deployed URL
   - Test all functionality
   - Check mobile responsiveness
   - Verify PDF generation works

5. **Post-Deployment**
   - Bookmark the URL
   - Test in different browsers
   - Share with users

## Common Issues

### Issue: Logo not showing
**Solution:** Ensure `logo.png` is uploaded and in the correct location

### Issue: PDF generation fails
**Solution:** Check browser console, ensure CDN resources load

### Issue: Styles not loading
**Solution:** Verify internet connection, CDN might be blocked

### Issue: Data not persisting
**Solution:** Check browser localStorage is enabled

## Security Notes

- ✅ No backend/server required
- ✅ All data stored in browser localStorage
- ✅ No external API calls (except CDN resources)
- ✅ No user authentication needed
- ⚠️ Data is local to each browser/device

## Performance

- Fast loading (CDN resources)
- No server processing
- Lightweight application
- Works offline (after initial load)
